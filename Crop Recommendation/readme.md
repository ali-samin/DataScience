Crop Recommendation Data Science Project

Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a Crop Recommendation data science project. The goal of this project is to develop a system that can recommend suitable crops to farmers based on various environmental and soil factors. Crop recommendation is crucial for maximizing agricultural productivity and ensuring food security.

Project Description

Agriculture is a critical sector that directly impacts the global food supply and economy. To support farmers in making informed decisions about crop selection, this project leverages data science techniques and machine learning algorithms to provide crop recommendations.

Features
Data Collection: This project gathers relevant data, including soil type, climate conditions, historical crop yields, and crop characteristics, from various sources.

Data Preprocessing: The collected data is cleaned, transformed, and prepared for modeling. Missing values and outliers are handled appropriately.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA is performed to gain insights into the dataset, visualize trends, and identify patterns that can influence crop selection.

Machine Learning Models: A variety of machine learning models, such as decision trees, random forests, and neural networks, are trained using historical data to predict the most suitable crops for a given set of environmental factors.

Model Evaluation: The models are evaluated using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall) to ensure their effectiveness in crop recommendation.

User Interface: A user-friendly interface is developed to input environmental and soil data and receive crop recommendations based on the trained models.
